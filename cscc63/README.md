## What is this course about?
This course is here to get you started in thinking about the *limits of
computation*: what sort of problems can we reasonably compute using
algorithms, and what problems we will never be able to fully answer?
And if we can compute the answer to a problem, how efficiently can we
do so?

Of course, we're designing more powerful computers all the time. So a
statement about the limitations of your laptop today may not apply in a
few years. In order to give limits that won't change, we have to talk about
the limitations of logic itself.
