# Turing Machines

## Multi-tape Turing Machines
Modify the single tape turing machine by adding another tape. This is the same as
a single TM, but we can work with multiple strings

![Multi-tape TM](./pictures/multi-tape-tm.png)

Say we have the following three strings:

\\(01q_1011\\)  
\\(000q_1\\)   
\\(q_11010\\)

These can be flattened into one TM:

\\(
01q_1011\\#
000q_1\\#
q_11010
\\)

If we shift the string down by one to denote the left-hand-side of the string,
we can make a TM that moves back and forth between the different strings.


\\(
$01q_1011\\#
000q_1\\#
q_11010
\\)

Add to \\(\Gamma, \dot{\Sigma}\\) all symbols of the input alphabet with
\\(\dot{}\\) above it, \\(\\#\\), and \\(\dot{\\#}\\)

S = "On input \\(w = w_1, w_2,...,w_n\\)
1. \\(\\#\dot{w_1}w_2...w_n\\#\dot{-}\\#\dot{-}\\#...\\#\\)
2. Move right, read symbols under each tape head
3. Second pass, move left, update tapes according to M's transition function
4. If TM encounters \\(\dot{\\#}\\), then it reached an unread blank portion
   of the tape. It writes a blank, and shifts all the content right of
   \\(\dot{\\#}\\) to the right

So, we can emulate multiple tapes with a single-tape TM. However, we have a time
cost. If our string has max length n, moving back and forth along the tape to
update positions take up to n times as many steps.

## Non-Deterministic Turing Machines
We can also have non-deterministic turing machines, where there are multiple
possible arrows out of a state. We accept if *any* choice leads to the accepting
state. 

![Non-Deterministic TM](./pictures/non-deterministic-tm.png)

\\(
q_0 $01x \rightarrow $q_101x \rightarrow $xq_21x \rightarrow $xyq_3x
\\)

From here, we have two choices to follow:  
\\($xyxq_1 \rightarrow \\) reject  
\\($xyxq_2 \rightarrow \\) accept

We can simulate a non-deterministic TM by performing a breadth-first search on
the configuration tree using multi-tape TMs

**input tape** contains the unaltered input  
**simulation tape** simulates some branch of the NTM  
**address tape** tells us what branch we're on

Start at the root, follow the first child, second child, third child,...

1. Initially, tape 2, 3 empty, 1 contains input \\(w\\)
2. Copy 1 to 2, initialize string on 3 to be \\(\epsilon\\)
3. Simulate n on 2, consult 3 for next branch to follow  
   If branch invalid, go to 4 (also if reject)  
   Elseif no tape 3 symbol, go to 4
4. Replace tape 3 string with next string in ordering  
   Simulate next branch by going to 2

So, we can simulate a NDTM with a TM. Similarly, there is a time cost. The
size of the tree can be exponentially large in height, so doing a BFS on a
configuration tree of an NTM can take exponentially longer than the running
time of the NTM.

## RAM model
In the RAM model, each tape cell has an address, we can jump to any address
during computation, and can read memory addresses from the tape to figure out
where to jump. Gives us a regular computer's architecture!

There is a \\(n^6\\) slowdown however, where n is the length of the string
