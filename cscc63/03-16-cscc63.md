Complexity and Probability

Talk about how we can incorporate random results into a turing machine.
Typically, we would have a randomness with a 50% chance of returning a 1.

Based on the random result bit, our programs will be random in:
* Outputs the correct answer for the program, but takes a random amount of time
	to find the answer
* 


ZPP = RP intersect co-RP

Run ZPP with a time limit, if below time limit, in RP
If past time limit, in co-RP

3SAT to a problem in a bayesian network

x y z c1:t cl:f
f f f 1    1
f f t 1    1
f t f 0    1
f t t 1    1
t f f 1    0
t f t 1    1
t t f 1    1
t t t 1    1

1 means probability 1, 0 means probability 0

\#p is harder than NP, and co-NP
\#P is easier than P space
