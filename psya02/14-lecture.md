# Social Psychology (Part 3)

Ali is a high school student who is very interested in Canadian politics, and
hopes one day to become an MP in Ottawa. He decides to start a club at his high
school for students to discuss political issues. Ali is very popular, so the
first meeting of his club is very well attended. However, because most of his
classmates don't know much about politics, Ali is disappointed to find that
they spend the entire hour discussing other students in their school, and not
the issues he had hoped to discuss. THis might be an example of what?
1. Group polarization
2. Social loafing
3. Deindividuation
4. Common knowledge effect
5. Diffusion of responsibility
> Common knowledge effect

Which of the following is NOT a reason that female humans tend to be more
selective in their sexual relationships than males?
1. Females incur a higher physical cost in reproduction than males do
2. Females incur a higher opportunity cost in reproduction than males do
3. There is a double standard in terms of the reputational risks associated
   with sex
4. Cultural courtship rituals encourage males to seek out mates and for females
   to be selective
5. When they first meet a potential mate, females place more value on
   psychological attributes than they do on physical attributes
>  When they first meet a potential mate, females place more value on
>  psychological attributes than they do on physical attributes

## Selectivity
Humans are **selective** in terms of their sexual partners. Women more so than
men, perhaps for:
* Biological reasons - Men can reproduce almost any time (sperm count), but
	women only about once a year.
* Societal pressure - Societally, men are expected to approach, while women are
	to be approached.

Selectivity is based on some factors:
* Physical Attraction
	* Varies from culture to culture
	* Beauty is universally beneficial
	* First thing we notice
* Situational Attraction
	* We try hard to like people that we are around
	* Tend to befriend people we have to spent a lot of time with (Mere
		Exposure Effect)
	* Especially in **psychologically arousing** situations (on a shaking
		bridge)
	* Perhaps the greatest factor in attraction
* Psychological Attraction
	* Easy to interact with people who are similar
	* Makes us feel confident that we are right
	* People more similar to us also *like* us more
	* Data shows "opposites attract" don't hold

## Social Influence
We all engage in (the attempt to) control other individuals

### Hedonic Motivation
Control people by appealing to their hedonic desires. Includes actions such as:
* Giving bonuses to hard working employees
* Rewarding children with snacks
* Government fines/jail sentences

Can backfire, if we convert some intrinsic motivation (kids who enjoy drawing),
into extrinsic motivation (get a prize if you do).

### Approval Motivation
Appeal to an individuals desire for approval. We are motivated to have others
like us and approve of us.

We follow the norms, as it makes us more likable (normative influence), but
causes us to conform to the behaviour of others.
