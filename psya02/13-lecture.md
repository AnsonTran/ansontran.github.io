## Ingroup/Outgroup biases
We often have in-group and out-group beliefs we're not aware of, called
**implicit biases**. Can affect behaviours, cognitions, and emotions in subtle
ways.

[Implicit Association Test](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/canada/takeatest.html)
is a way to measure these biases. It asks you to categorize things in a binary
way. Instead of asking you about your biases directly, it measures your
reaction time to categorizing things. Humans are slower at processing
information that conflicts with our cognition.

## Group cognition
Groups make cooperation less risky, but groups also have risks to decision
making:

* Common Knowledge Effect - Instead of talking about a topic that a small
	subset of the group are familiar with, groups will talk about more common
	topics that can be discussed with everyone in the group.
* Group Polarization - Groups can make decisions that are more extreme than any
	member would have made alone. If a group of scared people are together,
	they become even more scared by talking to each other.
* Deindividuation - Groups cause people to be less concerned with personal
	values. Gang member could do some action that they would not have committed
	if they were alone, but they become less concerned with consequences when
	they are together.
* Groupthink - Decisions in groups take a long time, debating back and forth,
	and sharing ideas. They can reach a concensus too early, to get it over
	with, or peer pressure from vocal members of the group.
* Diffusion of Responsibility - Individuals feel diminished responsibility for
	their actions when surrounded by others acting the same way. If there is a
	car crash, you may drive past thinking 'someone else will just help them'

Group cognition is thought to have evolved to help us survive from scarcity of
resources. We think that people outside the group will steal resources from the
group. As we have more resources than we need, hopefully our ingroup bises will
subside, which seems to be the case historically.

## Altruism
Altruism is behaviour that benefits another without benefitting oneself. In any
case that may seem like altruism, there can be arguments that argue against it
being a case of altruism.

If someone gives a dollar to a homeless person, one can argue that the person
giving receives societal benefits (oh wow look at me, im such a nice person).

In non-human animals, we see altruism in:
* kinship selection - taking care of related kin, to increase likelihood of
	their genetic material being passed on
* reciprocation - protecting another, with expectation that the favour will be
	returned

We would not call this true altruism however, because there is some kind of way
of benefitting them.
