# PSYA02 Introduction to Psychology II

University of Toronto Scarborough  
Introduction to Clinical, Developmental, Personality and Social Psychology  
Winter 2020

## General Course Information
This course is the second part of Introduction to Psychology. Along with PSYA01, this course provides students
with an overview of the foundational aspects of psychological science. In PSYA02, we will continue covering
some of the basic building blocks of psychology, such as intelligence, emotion, social psychology, and personality.
We?ll also spend some time discussing developmental change across the lifespan. Finally, we?ll finish the term
by exploring atypical patterns in psychology, including psychological disorders and the treatment of them.
We think that there is something for everyone in this course. Even if you don?t think that you have thought deeply
about psychology before, we in fact are all amateur psychological scientists, constantly pondering and analyzing
our own psychological states and those of others around us. We hope that you will find aspects of this course to
be applicable to and enriching of your daily lives. 

After you finish the PSYA01 and PSYA02 sequence of courses, you?ll be prepared to dive further into psychological
science at the B level. We hope that, after this experience, you?ll be motivated to do so!
