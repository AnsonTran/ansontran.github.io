# Clinical Psychology (Part 3)

## Bipolar Disorder
When we were talking about depressive orders, we called them **unipolar**. They
were on one pole, specifically the negative pole.

Bipolar disorders are characterized by cycles of abnormal, persistent high mood
(mania) and low mood (depression).

**Bipolar 1 disorder** - at least one manic episode, possibly with hypomanic
(hypo meeaning below) and depressive episodes as well

**Bipolar 2 disorder** - presence of both hypomanic and depressive episodes; no
manic episodes.

Diagnostic Criteria:
1. Distinct period of abnormal, persistenly elevated mood; increased activity
   or energy; lasting at least 1 week (manic episode)
2. Three or more of the following
	* Inflated self-esteem
	* Decreased need for sleep
	* Talkative
	* Racing thoughts
	* Distractibility
	* Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation
	* Excessive involvement in activities with high potential for painful
	  consequences (driving fast, thrill seeking)

Prevalance:
* 1 in 40 individuals
* Not different between women and men (1.1:1 ratio)

Onset:
* Mean age of first episode = 18 years
* Onset can occur for the fist time in the 60s and 70s

Prognosis:
* 90% of individuals who experience a manic episode will experience more of
  them throughout life
* Full remission is very rare

Risk factors:
* Genetic (among most heritable disorders; coincident among identical twins
  40-70%)
* Environmental (high stress, highly emotionally expressive family members;
  separation/divorce)
* Psychological (high neuroticism, high conscientiousness)

Comorbidity:
* Anxiety disorders
* Substance use disorders
* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
* Behavioural disorders

## Personality Disorder
Unusual patterns of behaviour (relative to one's cultural context) that are
maladaptive, distressing to oneself or others, and resistant to change.

There are three different clusters of personality disorders:
1. Odd/Eccentric
2. Dramatic/Emotional/Erratic
3. Anxious/Fearful/Inhibited

## Antisocial Personality Disorder
Pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others,
beginning in childhood and lasting through adulthood.

Diagnostic Criteria:
1. Three or more of the following:
	* Failure to conform to social norms with respect to lawful behaviour
	* Deceitfulness
	* Impulsivity/failure to plan ahead
	* Irritability/aggresiveness
	* Reckless disregard for own or others' safety
	* Irresponsibility
	* Lack of remorse
2. The individual must be at least 18 years of age
3. Evidence of conduct disorder in childhood
	* Persistent pattern of behaviour involving aggression to people or animals,
		destruction of property, deceitfulness, theft, etc.
4. Not exclusively during the course of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder

With other disorders, people report their behaviours causing individual
distress and problems. However, people with antisocial personality disorder
attribute their success to this pattern of behaviour and so they do not report
it as such. We have to take account of the greater good of the community
(distress caused to people in contact with someone with this disorder).

## Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder
**Obsession**:A pattern of unwanted, inappropriate, and persistent thoughts  
**Compulsion**: Repetitive, ritualistic behaviours

Both are really related to each other. Compulsions are a mechanism for
controlling their obsession. For example, people with an obsession of being
clean, develop a compulsion to do lots of cleaning.

Common obsessions and the common compulsions for it:
* Contamination - Cleaning
* Doubting - Checking
* Arranging things in a specific pattern - Repeating actions
* Aggressive thoughts
