## Psychodynamic Approach

### Sigmund Freud (Maybe from PSYA01)
* Austrian physician practicing neurology, study of disorders of the nervous system.
* Treated patients for "hysteria"
* Developed **psychoanalysis** based on patient's free associations, fantasies, and dreams
> Hysteria - Exagerrated or uncontrollable emotion or excitement

Psychodynamic theory extends from Freud's approach
* Personality is formed by needs, strivings, and desires largely operating **outside of awareness**
* Motives that can also produce emotional disorders
* Called the **dynamic unconscious**
    > An active system encompassing a lifetime of hidden memories, the person's deepest
    > instincts and desires, and the person's inner struggle to control those forces

### Psychodynamic Theory
Freud divided this dynamic (un)conscious into three parts
* Id - unconscious, animal desires
* Ego - more conscious, control animalistic desires, for life's practical demands
    * planning
    * future goals
    * can't constantly act on id, or we can't advance our goals
* Superego - internalize cultural/social rules
Personality is determined by which of these parts of the unconscious are dominant

Conflicts between the three parts cause **anxiety**
To resolve this anxiety, we rely on **defence mechanisms**
* Repression - push thoughts away, ignore, and deny
* Rationalization - explain, give motivation for feeling 
* Reaction formation - acting in way that is opposite of insecurity
    > person that is weak starts acting tough and macho
* Projection - criticizing another person for behaving in a way you feel yourself
    > having a bad time at a party, and saying someone else looks like they're having a bad time
* Regression - return to a more childish version of yourself
* Displacement - take out anger to someone/something that is not the cause of the feeling
    > slamming a door after an argument
* Identification - identify with the cause of the negative feelings
    > kid being bullied becomes a bully themself
* Sublimation - taking their negative emotionality and turning it into something positive
    > kid experiences bullying, and starts anti-bullying club

### Projective Techniques
Analyze responses to standard series of ambiguous stimuli. Reveal inner aspects of individual's personalities.
Pictures of people, objects, events, or abstract stimuli shown to subjects
* Rorschach Ink Blot test
    * inner thoughts and feelings revealed by analysis of their responses
    * common set of responses, uncommon might mean something wrong
* Thematic apperception test (TAT)
    * shown a card and told to make a story based on it
    * common sets of responses
    * might correlate similar themes to similar problems

Lots of criticisms:
* Clinician or social pressure can alter results. Patient crafts responses
* Results difficult to interpret
* Interpretations are too subjective, relies on clinician's own psychology
* Mixed empirical evidence to support them
* Focus on after-the-fact interpretation, no predictive power
* Reject free will, everything predetermined by early childhood experience
* Based on biased sample
* Are unfalsifiable, hard to argue results are right or wrong

## Humanistic-Existential Approach
Argues humans seek out a realization of their inner potential
(self-actualization)
* pursuit of knowledge
* expression of creativity
* spiritual enlightenment
* give back to society

### Maslow's Needs Hierarchy
People need to satisfy needs from the bottom of the pyramid before we can move
up. Personality differences arise from environmental constraints against
climbing our needs hierarchy

> Sarah is a highly creative person with a natural talent for story-telling. However, she lives in a war
> torn developing nation, and is too busy making sure her family have enough to eat and are safe. She
> cannot explore her talent. She is less agreeable than she would be if she could explore her talent.

## Human Development (Part 1)
Examination of **continuity** and **change** across the lifespan on these topics:
* Sensation and perception
* Cognition and language
* Emotion
* Social and moral behaviour
Will cover four main periods of human development
* Prenatality and infancy (conception-2,3 years)
* Childhood (2,3-11 years)
* Adolescence (12-17 years)
* Adulthood (18-death)

* Early memories are often vague or non-existent.
* Early experiences in infancy are crucial to normal development
* Gives rise to many individual differences across human population
* Human experience begins with **conception** not birth
* Infant at 20-22 weeks can experience sound 

### Prenatal Development
Period of time prior to birth
* Gestational age is time since beginning of last menstrual period
    > Mothers dont always know time of fertilization but know time of last period
