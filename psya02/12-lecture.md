## Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Motivation
**Intrinsic motivation**: motivation to take actions that are themselves
rewarding. Eating chips, ice cream, etc.

**Extrinsic motivation**: motivation to take actions that eventually lead to a
separate reward. Studying for a test to get a high mark, working a job to buy
stuff

Extrinsic motivations tend to be weak in early childhood and among non-human
animals.

## Approach vs Avoidance Motivation
**Approach motivation**: motivation to experience a **positive** income

**Avoidance motivation**: motivation to not experience a **negative** outcome

Generally, avoidance motivation tends to be stronger (evolutionary survival).
However, it may differ across individuals.

## Ultrasocial
Humans are considered ultrasocial animals. Some other ultrasocial animals are:
* ants and bees
* termites
* naked mole rats

Ultrasocial animals form large societies, divide labour, and cooperate for
mutual benefit.

## Social Psychology
Study of causes and consequences of being social:
* aggression
* cooperation
* altruism
* reproduction

## Aggression
Aggression is the behaviour with the purpose of harming another. Can be another member of the same species or towards another species.

All humans aggress, some are more likely than others to do so. Based on some
factors:
* biological factors:
	* genetics
	* sex - males are overall more aggressive than females
	* testosterone levels
* environmental factors
	* culture
	* societal expectations

Males are on the whole more aggressive than females.

Males are more physically aggressive than they are relationally aggressive.

Females are more relationally aggressive than they are physically aggressive.

Aggression is **evolutionarily adaptive**. However, aggression has decreased
significantly in the last century.

Because of the short time that aggression has decreased, it suggests
that there is another factor other than evolution that affects aggression
Certain cultures are far more (or less) violent than others.
* scarcity of resources
* gender equality


### Frustration-Aggression Hypothesis
Animals aggress against another animal when their desires are frustrated.

Some argue that this hypothesis is too narrow. For example, people are more
likely to aggress on hot days/months. Murder rates go up, pitches are more
likely to hit the batter, etc.

Others argue that this can also be reduced to the frustration-aggression
hypothesis. People want to have a good day, and the heat gets in the way.

### Testosterone
Testosterone does not appear to directly cause aggression. It appears to
decrease and individuals' **threat assessment**. People with more testosterone
are less afraid of retaliation.

## Cooperation
Behvior where two or more individuals work together that leads to mutual
benefit. Cooperation is another way of solving our scarcity of resources.

We don't cooperate all the time because cooperation is risky. Sometimes people
take advantage of other people's cooperation (working with someone in a group
project who doesn't pull their own weight). Or, a group member having a
different goal in mind (to sabotage the group).

To minimize the risk, we cooperate in groups. Collections of people that have
something in common that distinguishes them from others. i.e. families, teams,
religions, ethnicities, nations, etc.

Tend to have **positive prejudices** and exhibit **positive discrimination**
toward members of our in-group.

Group cognition is deeply enrained in human evolution
* present in non-human primates
* arises in early childhood
* can be caused spontaneously and arbitrarily (people with same color shirts,
  arm band color, sports teams)
