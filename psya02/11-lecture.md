## Emotional Expression
Observable **signs** of an emotional state (not symbols, symbols have an
arbitrary relationship with the thing that it represents). People can read your
emotional state and figure out whether you're angry or sad, etc.
* Facial expression
* Tone of voice
* Body language
* Rhythm of gait (walk fast when angry, walk slow when sad)

## Charles Darwin's Universality Hypothesis
Proposed that facial expressions are **evolved** and therefore **universal** in
the human population.

He believed facial gestures evolved in order to aid in survival.

### Support for Universality Hypothesis
* People with visual impairments, have never seen a smiling face, also smile
* 2-day old infants produce disgusted faces similar to adults
* Isolated cultures evaluate Westerners' facial expressions the same way that
  other Westerners do

### Criticisms for Universality Hypothesis
Relationships between different emotions are different across cultures
* North American culture, think of happiness and joy, sadness and despair as
  opposite emotions
* In other cultures, happiness and sadness may be more closely related to each
  other

There are cultures where smiling may mean something different (Thailand)

## Facial Feedback Hypothesis
Based on common sense, most people agree that emotional state comes first
before facial expressions.

Hypothesis argues that facial expressions can cause/change an individual's
emotional experience. Does not argue that it causes all changes in emotional
state, but there can be a feedback loop.

By holding pen between their teeth, it forces them to smile and puts them in a
more positive emotional state.

## Deceptive Expression
There are many reasons we may want to hide our emotions

**Intensification**  
Making an expression seem more intensified than how you're actually feeling
1. You get socks for Christmas, but it's not the most exciting gift
2. You feel somewhat grateful, but not too excited
3. You intensify your feeling of gratefulness

**De-intensification**  
Downplay an emotional state
1. You're on a date with someone you're very excited about
2. You don't want them to think you're "totally nuts"
3. Pull back. You de-intensify your excitedness

**Masking**  
Changing an emotional expression into another
1. You're really disappointed, when someone buys you a shirt with a bad color
2. Mask that disappointment, change it to gratitude

**Neutralizing**  
Turning off an emotional expression
1. Your dog dies
2. You're at work, and want to stay professional
3. You turn off the feeling of sadness

## Detecting a Fake Expression
As well, we can determine whether facial expressions are real or not

**Morphology**
* Certain facial muscles are resistant to conscious change (reliable muscles)
* Its much harder to control your eyes than it is to control your mouth. You can
  tell whether an expression is real is through these reliable muscles.

**Symmetry**
* In genuine expressions, we see smmetrical facial gestures
* Uneven/unbalanced facial gestures are more likely to be insecure.

**Duration**  
* Sincere expressions last between 0.5s and 5s
* A short facial expression is a queue that the expression is insecure.

**Temporal Patterning**  
* Microexpressions appear first and are sincere
* You see things like the eyes changing, before the smile starts to appear.
  Sincere gestures appear and disappear gradually rather than suddenly.

## Motivation
Psychological reason for producing an action, primarily driven by emotion.

Emotion changes actions by giving us information about an object, event, or
individual. Also provides instructions on what to do with new information.

**Hedonic principle**: All motivation extends from attraction to pleasure and
avoidance of paint. Our primary motivator, for **everything** is pleasure. We
do unpleasant activities to achieve this pleasure goal.
