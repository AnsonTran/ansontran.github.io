1. No city can be named more than once
2. The last letter of the current city named must be the first letter of the
   next
3. The last person who can't continue the path loses

GG = INPUT: A directed graph G, a starting node s.
	 QUESTiON: Does player 1 have a winning move?

Recursively call GG on different subgraphs on G

phi = for all x,y, exists z, (x || z) && (y! || z)

choose z, such that any choice of x and y results in a winning move (true).

player 1 makes first choice

s +--v1->

player 1 and 2 take turns, want player 2 to choose x and y, player 1 choose z

arrows point back to the nodes in the graph, but too hard to draw

# Logarithmic Space
L = {L|L is decided by a TM that operates in O(logn) space}
NL = {L|L is decided by a ntm that operates in O(logn) space}

Remember that we can simulate a NTM with a TM using a quadratic blowup in
space.

NTM in O(logn) ----> TM O(log^2n)
