3SAT is NP-Complete

for all L in NP, L maps to 3SAT

We don't have to look at all L in NP, map A b-NTM to 3SAT

A b-NTM = { <M, w, r> | M is an NTM that accepts w in r steps} (bounded NTM)
c0 = q1w0,w1,...,w(n-1), c1=t(1,1)q1w1,w2,...,w(n-1) ...  ##q0     w0 w1 ... w(n-1) ... ##
##t(0,1) q1 w1 ... w(n-1) ... ##
.

.

maximum r=cn^k steps, c*n^k rows and columns. Valid instance if enters
accepting state somewhere within the table.

Try to build 3CNF that does all of these
* Every call has 1 character - phi cell
* The start configuration is ##q0w0..._## - phi start
* There is an accept state in the table - phi accept
* The difference between rows are legal TM moves - phi move

phi = phi cell ^ phi start ^ phi accept ^ phi move

x(i,j,s) = {T - if is cell i,j,s
		   {F - otherwise

x(0,0,#)=T
X(0,0,_)=F

phi cell
	fix i,j:
		cell [i,j] has a character
		V(s in gamma) (x(i,j,s))
	(a or b or c or d or ...) - or together all the t/f into one big clause
	(a) -> (a or a or a) - if its too short, we can just repeat a variable
	(a or b or c or d) -> (a or b or x) and (x or c or d) - chaining allows us
	to break larger clauses into smller clauses
	V(s in gamma) (x(i,j,s)) and A(s in gamma) (x(i,j,s)->not) or x(i,j,s')->not)
	if theres a cell with a hash and _, answer should not change when asked
	twice
	phi cell = A(i,j) phi(i,j,cell)

phi start
	= x(0,0,#) and x(0,1,#) and x(0,2,w0) and ... and x(0,cn^k+3,#)
	just manually tell me what the first row is

phi accept
	iterate over all cells and check if at least one has an accepting state
	x(0,0,qA) or x(0,1,qA) or ...
	phi accept = V(i,j) x(i,j,qA)

phi move
	have a 2x3 window
	# q0     w0
	# t(1,1) q1

	_ _ #
	_ _ #

	we have to check that all 2x3 windows are possible TM moves

	q0     w0 w1
	t(1,1) q1 q1

	this would be an invalid window, as a TM would not be able to do this from
	configuration to configuration. t(1,1) is whatever we choose to write at
	that cell.

	fix on i,j:
		phi moveij = True iff window at i,j is legal
		at most |gamma|^6 windows

	# q0 0
	# 1  q1    is equivalent to (x(i,j,#) and x(i,j+1,q0) and x(i,j+2,0) and
								 x(i+1,j,#) and x(i+1,j+1,1) and x(i+1,j+2,q1))

	phi move:ij = V(A: A is legal) ( clause from above )

	phi move = A(i,j) phi move:ij

3SAT is satisfiable iff the turing machine makes sense

phi cell is O(n^k)
phi start is O(n^k)
phi accept is O(n^2k)
phi move is O(n^2k)
phi is O(n^k)

non-deterministically, we have some part of the starting configuration not
provided to us.

##q0 0101?????__##

We can decide what that is, and that will be our certificate

0 q0 1

-> 0 q0 1
   10 0 x

OR

-> 0 q0 1
   0 x q1

Both are valid turing machine moves, so we include both at phi move.
